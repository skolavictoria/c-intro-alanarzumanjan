# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practical Session

In this practical session, we will explore the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Minecraft mechanics as analogies. Just like Minecraft blocks and tools have unique properties and interactions, we'll learn about classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism in the context of programming.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Creating a Class and Object (Minecraft Blocks)

1. Create a new class called `MinecraftBlock` that represents a Minecraft block.
2. Define attributes (properties) for the block, such as `name`, `texture`, and `hardness`.
3. Implement a constructor to initialize these attributes when creating a new block.
4. Create multiple instances (objects) of your `MinecraftBlock` class with different attributes.
5. Display the properties of each block in your program.

### Task 2: Implementing Encapsulation (Minecraft Chests)

1. Create a class called `MinecraftChest` to represent a locked chest in Minecraft.
2. Define attributes like `content` (what's inside the chest) and `lockStatus` (locked or unlocked).
3. Implement methods to lock and unlock the chest, and to add and remove items from the chest.
4. Demonstrate how encapsulation keeps the chest's content safe and can only be accessed through the defined methods.

### Task 3: Inheritance (Modifying Minecraft Blocks)

1. Start with a base class called `MinecraftBlock` (from Task 1).
2. Create a derived class called `SpecialMinecraftBlock` that inherits from `MinecraftBlock`.
3. Add new attributes or modify existing attributes in the `SpecialMinecraftBlock` class to represent a unique block.
4. Create instances of both the base and derived classes and display their attributes.

### Task 4: Demonstrating Polymorphism (Using Minecraft Tools)

1. Create a class called `MinecraftTool` to represent tools in Minecraft, such as pickaxes, shovels, and swords.
2. Define methods for each tool, such as `mine()`, `dig()`, and `attack()`.
3. Create instances of the `MinecraftTool` class and demonstrate how the same tool (method) can have different effects on different blocks (objects).

## How to Submit

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b oop-practical`.
4. Complete the tasks in your code editor.
5. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) to submit your work.
